        	<h2>What are Graph Databases?</h2>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	  <h3>Introduction</h3>
        	<p>Graph Databases are a novel new way to represent large amounts of data by utilizing a graph structure made up of nodes and edges. The nodes represent the data (person, place, thing…) and the edges are the relationships that data has with other data items. This method of storage is very different from the more commonly used relational and the other types of NOSQL databases of today. Relational databases commonly store structured tabled data but do little with the relationships between data. Because graph databases keep relationships stored with the data, and give relationships priority, they can be queried faster than any relational database can hope to do. Relational databases often require computational heavy and complex join calls to achieve what graph databases can do easily.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p>This is all important because big connected data is becoming increasingly popular. Determining relationships and making calculations based on data connections is becoming a very important part of big data today. Traditional relational databases simply can’t keep up with graph databases as the number and depth of relationships constantly increase. Graph databases can succeed because, for them, connected data is more important than individual data points.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Neo4j is a very popular native graph database solution. Native databases are better in that they are more efficient at processing graph data because connected nodes are pointed to each other in the database making for an actual connected graph, not just a simulated one. Neo4j is a great starting point for learning graph databases do to it being fully fleshed out and having all the features the most popular relational databases have. It supports scalability, indexing, and provides reliability support through things such as replication. Neo4j also has an easy to use built in web application that allows users to get started right away.</p>
